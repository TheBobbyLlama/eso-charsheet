# Roleplay System for Elder Scrolls Online

This is a site to facillitate roleplaying in the game [The Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/).  It is a effectively a dice rolling system that emulates the tabletop gaming experience one would have with a game like Dungeons & Dragons - players participate in encounters designed by a Game Master.

## Player Portal
This includes:
- A character sheet page where players can create and save their characters for use in the system.
- A 'Rollplay' page where players can participate in roleplaying sessions by making dice rolls.
- A profile page where characters can be browsed and viewed.

## GM Screen
The GM Screen is where the Game Master controls the action.  From here, the GM can design encounters by adding players and enemies.  The GM can initiate rolls against players which they must respond to, or deal with rolls the players have made.  The GM has complete control over the outcomes, the system does not call success or failure for them.  The facillitate this, any rolling the GM does is hidden from players, they only see the results the GM decides.
