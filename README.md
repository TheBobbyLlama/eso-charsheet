# ESO Rollplay

This is a site to facillitate roleplaying in the game [The Elder Scrolls Online](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/).  It is a dice rolling system that emulates the tabletop gaming experience one would have with a game like Dungeons & Dragons - players participate in encounters designed by a game master.
